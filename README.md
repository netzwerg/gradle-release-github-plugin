gradle-release-pub-plugin
=========================

Gradle plugin complementing the ['ch.netzwerg.release' plugin](https://github.com/netzwerg/gradle-release-plugin):
Supports publication of releases through configurable channels.

# Channel Type 'github'

Creates a GitHub release via [official REST API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release).
Requires [curl](http://curl.haxx.se).

## Configuration
### JSON File

Requires a file named `release-github.json` whose contents will be passed to the GitHub API. Any tokens will be replaced
beforehand.

Example:

```json
{
 "tag_name" : "@tagName@",
 "name" : "Testing at @timeStamp@",
 "body" : "Test release body"
}
```

### Build File

```groovy
release {
    publish {
        github {
            repo = 'git-playground'
            user = 'netzwerg'
            password = "$GITHUB_PASSWORD"
            tokens = [tagName: release.tagName, timeStamp: new Date()]
        }
    }
}
```

# Channel Type 'mail'

_Coming soon_
